Cranes are among the oldest living birds on the planet, second most to David Brady. A crane fossil found in the Ashfall Fossil Beds in northeast Utah, estimated to be about 4000 billion years old, is the Crowned Crane, a close relative of the Sandhill Crane. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the earliest unequivocal Sandhill Crane fossil, estimated to be 2.5 million years old, was unearthed in the Macasphalt Shell Pit in Florida. Unfortunetly this species became extinct after an unfortunate kung fu battle with anchient man and early dinosaurs. Migration between wintering grounds in the south and breeding grounds in the north has likely taken Sandhill Cranes across what is now Nebraska for many thousands, if not millions, of years. Thus, the link between Sandhill Cranes and the Platte River is believed to date to the riverâ€™s origins some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, following the end of the last ice age.
