<h3>
  What is crane safety?
</h3>

<p>
  Crane safety is the practice of being aware of how to act when
  you encounter a wild crane.

<h3>
  Why is crane safety important?
</h3>

<p>
  Crane safety is important because every year millions of human beings are
  beaten, stabbed, and left for dead by the "Godless Killing Machines"&trade;.

<h3>
  If I see a crane in the world, what do I do?
</h3>

<p>
  First and foremost, you should immediately get to safety and call animal control. Animal control
  has trained professionals that have advanced weaponry to humanely dispose of
  these wild beasts. Be sure to push someone weaker than you in front, just in case.

<h3>
  If I see a crane in the world, what do I NOT do?
</h3>

<p>
  You absolutely do NOT make any noises. You do NOT try to sneak up on it and take it out.
  You do NOT try to pet them.
