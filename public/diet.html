  <h2>Sandhill Cranes: Ravenous Marauders</h2>

  <p>Sandhill cranes are omnivorous, with a diet heavy in seeds and cultivated
  grains, but may also include berries, tubers, small vertebrates, and invertebrates.
  Nonmigratory populations eat adult and larval insects, snails, reptiles, amphibians,
  nestling birds, small mammals, seeds, and berries. As migratory birds, cranes
  will move south and east during the winter as food becomes scarce.</p>
