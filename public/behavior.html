  <h1>How does a crane protects iself from predators</h1>
    cranes, like all wild creatures, must defend themselves occasionally. ...
    During night time, whooping cranes try to roost in a shallow river or lake
    to help protect themselves from predators like coyotes and bob cats.
    During day time they can hold off some predators with their sharp beak.

  <h1>Sleeping habits of the crane</h1>
    Most species of cranes sleep at night standing on the ground. They generally
    prefer to stand in shallow water, often on one leg, with their heads and
    necks tucked on or under one of their shoulders. In the breeding season
    cranes will sleep at or near to their nests so they can guard their eggs or
    chicks. In the non-breeding season most cranes roost in flocks for safety at
    traditional roosting sites.
