  <h1>Where is the crane found?</h1>
  <div>
    The cranes have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring across most of the
    world continents. They are absent from Antarctica and, mysteriously, South
    America. East Asia is the centre of crane diversity, with eight species,
    followed by Africa, which holds five resident species and wintering
    populations of a sixth.

  <h1>What natural surroundings does the crane need to survive?</h1>
  <div>
    Cranes usually nest in small, isolated wetlands—such as marshes, bogs, and
    swales—or within about 300 yards of the edges of larger ones. They prefer
    areas with vegetation growing in standing water, but some nest on dry
    ground.
